This repository was generated by making a copy of https://gitlab.ow2.org/sat4j/sat4j.git
and then doing a git checkout 2_3_5. The result was used to create a new repo,
git@github.com:randoop/grt-sat4j-core-2.3.5.git, from the copy.
Then the following changes were made:
  git rm -r org.sat4j.br4cp org.sat4j.csp org.sat4j.csp.xmlparser org.sat4j.intervalorders
  git rm -r org.sat4j.maxsat org.sat4j.pb org.sat4j.sat org.sat4j.scala org.sat4j.sudoku
  (changes to pom.xml to get build working - see git log)
